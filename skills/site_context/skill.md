# Skill: site_context

## Purpose
Provide consistent context about the user's website/business and how the agent should respond.

## When to use
Use this skill whenever the user asks anything about:
- the website content, structure, pages, sections
- what to write on the site (copy, sections, CTA)
- what info to ask from the client
- how to explain the service clearly and simply

## Inputs to ask for (only if missing)
- Website type (personal site / company / e-commerce / landing)
- Languages needed
- Key sections/pages (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact)
- Contact method (form/email/telegram)
- Any examples/competitors (optional)

## Output rules
- Be concise and practical.
- If user is angry: stay calm, answer only what is asked.
- Offer next steps as short actionable items.

## Default assumptions (if user didn’t specify)
- Simple site: up to 5 pages, with images and contact form.
- Goal: clear presentation + lead capture.
